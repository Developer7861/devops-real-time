#1.Jenkins: Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration, and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase, and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven, and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.

##Builds: Builds can be triggered by various means, for example:

    (a)a webhook that gets triggered upon pushed commits in a version control system
    (b)scheduling via a cron-like mechanism
    (c)requesting a specific build URL.
    (d)after the other builds in the queue have completed
    (e)invoked by other builds
